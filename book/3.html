<h2>Hi Friends</h2>
<br>
So why learn Ruby? What's the reasoning? Why so many crusaders for something that runs off chunky bacon 
and belief in human happiness? Surely it must be absurd? But that is nigh. For here we come to a land where
the dark arts' secrets read like english, the rich and intelligent share with the poor and ignorant, and the
world leaves it's garage door unlocked so you can check out and use your neighbors tools, or maybe even build
them and yourself some better ones.

<h3>Ruby is from a different world.</h3>
And it will help you control yours. It is free. It is powerful. It is pretty. It is also available readily to
play anytime.
No, no, no. This isn't cousin Tommy and his big, bench pressing guns. Its brothersisterlifepartner Ruby.<br>

And its here to help you explore!

We have friends. Or, you may have used to. Or you never have. Who cares. 
POINT IS
Folks got names.

In programming, there are usually said to be two hard things:

Time zones.

Naming things.

Well poo. Why are we starting with one of the hard ones?

Well, because like a good human-based (or bovine-based, or orca-based) language has a certain eloquence to it.

You don't stare listen to the French guy's story about eating a duck because you hate ducks, and seek to hear
a tale of a European man consuming one be regaled in great detail. You listen because,

<i>Swiggity Swiggity Swooty, that Franch sure sounds snooty</i>

But you get past this. A moment goes. Maybe a decade. You grok not just the terms but the meaning as a whole.

You <i>get</i> it.

But one doesn't have to <i>get</i> Ruby.

One merely just has to do it, for it is so simple. Let us start.
