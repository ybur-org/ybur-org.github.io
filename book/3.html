<h2>Hi Friends</h2>
<br>
So why learn Ruby? What's the reasoning? Why so many crusaders for something that runs off chunky bacon 
and belief in human happiness? Surely it must be absurd? But that is nigh. For here we come to a land where
the dark arts' secrets read like english, the rich and intelligent share with the poor and ignorant, and the
world leaves it's garage door unlocked so you can check out and use your neighbors tools, or maybe even build
them and yourself some better ones.

<h3>Ruby is from a different world.</h3>
And it will help you control yours. It is free. It is powerful. It is pretty. It is also available readily to
play anytime.
No, no, no. This isn't cousin Tommy and his big, bench pressing guns. Its brothersisterlifepartner Ruby.<br>

And its here to help you explore!
